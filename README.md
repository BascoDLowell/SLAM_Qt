# SLAM Qt

This is a simple repository to study "[SLAM for dummies](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/aeronautics-and-astronautics/16-412j-cognitive-robotics-spring-2005/projects/1aslam_blas_repo.pdf)".

## To do:
###### Simulation
- [x] Create a map generator with [cellular automata method](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Cellular_Automata_Method_for_Generating_Random_Cave-Like_Levels).
- [ ] Create a vehicle than can run in the map and collide with it.
- [ ] Create a 'sonar like' sensor to the vehicle.

SLAM for dummies appears to be Free, but I'm not sure.
